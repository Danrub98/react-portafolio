## Description
     This project was created with react, and it displays my professional portafolio, where people can look at the projects 
     that I have created. The project was created with react, the application has several pages that have their own personal
     folder, and it has a link to download my resume and direct access to my LinkedIn. In the future, I would like to add more 
     information to my portafolio, to make it more appeling and interactive with the User.

## Contribution
     The project can be forked, but always having in mind that my personal information cannot be displayed without my authorization.
    
## Test
     There are no test instructions.
